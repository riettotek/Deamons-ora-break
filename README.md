## Linux & Windows compatibility
Linux: show desktop notifications with [notify-send](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/en/man1/notify-send.1.html) and manage the notification schedule with a [systemd timer](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.timer.html)\
Windows: show desktop notifications with [Windows Script Host](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3106806/how-to-show-a-popup-without-a-browser) and manage the schedule with [Task Scheduler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/taskschd/task-scheduler-start-page).

----
## Extra
U can do more with the shell script. It uses the osascript command , passing an argument with `-e` flag as an _Applescript statement_ (the is the default language)\
Here is some examples:\
